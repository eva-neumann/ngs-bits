# *ngs-bits* - Short-read sequencing tools


## Obtaining ngs-bits

There are no binary releases yet.  
Please use git to download the most recent development version:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits.git

### Resolving proxy issues with git

If you are behind a proxy that block the standard git port, you see something like this:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits.git
    Cloning into 'ngs-bits'...
    fatal: Unable to look up github.com (port 9418) (Name or service not known)

Then you have to adapt your ~/.gitconfig file like that:

    [http]
    proxy = http://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]


## Building ngs-bits

### Dependencies

ngs-bits depends on the following software to be installed

* _g++_ (4.5 or higher)
* _qmake_ (Qt 5.3 or higher, including xmlpatterns and mysql package)
* _git_ (to extract the version hash)
* _cmake_ (to build the [bamtools](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools) library)
* __optional:__ python and matplotlib (for plot generation in QC tools)

For example, the installation of the dependencies using Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 looks like that:

	> sudo apt-get install g++ qt5-default libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev libqt5sql5-mysql git cmake python python-matplotlib

### Building

Just execute the following make commands:

    make build_3rdparty
	make build_tools_release

Now the executables and all required libraries can be found in the bin/ folder!

**Note:** Instructions how to build *ngs-bits* unter Windows can be found [here](doc/install_win.md).

## Support

Please report any issues or questions to the [ngs-bits issue 
tracker](https://github.com/imgag/ngs-bits/issues).

## Tools list

_ngs-bits_ contains a lot of tools that we use for NGS short-read data analysis in our [institute](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/Klinische_Genetik/start.html). Not all of these tools are mature enough for public use. Thus, here we will list tools that can be safely used:

### Main tools

* [SeqPurge](doc/tools/SeqPurge.md) - A highly-sensitive adapter trimmer for paired-end short-read data ([paper](http://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-016-1069-7), [poster](doc/data/SeqPurge_poster.pdf) from ECCB 2016 with more recent benchmarks).
* [SampleCorrelation](doc/tools/SampleCorrelation.md) - Calculates the variant overlap and correlation of two VCF/BAM files.
* [SampleGender](doc/tools/SampleGender.md) - Determines sample gender based on a BAM file.
* [PERsim](doc/tools/PERsim.md) - Paired-end read simulator for Illumina reads.
* [CnvHunter](doc/tools/CnvHunter.md) - CNV detection from targeted resequencing data using non-matched control samples.

### QC tools

The default output format of the quality control tools is [qcML](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/qcML-development/), an XML-based format for -omics quality control, that consists of an [XML schema](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/qcML-development/blob/master/schema/v0_0_8/qcML_0.0.8.xsd), which defined the overall structure of the format, and an [ontology](https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/qcML-development/blob/master/cv/qc-cv.obo) which defines the QC metrics that can be used.

* [ReadQC](doc/tools/ReadQC.md) - Quality control tool for FASTQ files.
* [MappingQC](doc/tools/MappingQC.md) - Quality control tool for a BAM file.
* [VariantQC](doc/tools/VariantQC.md) - Quality control tool for a VCF file.
